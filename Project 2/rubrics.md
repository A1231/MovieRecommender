### &nbsp;&nbsp; Improvements in Project 2

We improved and modernized the functionality and user experience of the movie recommendation system. The goal was to improve both the system's appeal and overall user experience. Important improvements included:
We provided a modern user interface with a simple layout, making it simpler for users to interact with and traverse. We made it netflix-themed to increase its appeal and familiarity.

The OMDb API's integration forms a major part of our upgrade. This gave us access to crucial movie information, including genre, IMDb ratings, and movie posters. Our users now have access to more information about the movie that is being recommended to them.

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) problem was one of the technical issues we ran into and overcame. We have fixed this problem and included the "access-control-allow-origin" header. These combined improvements have produced a movie selection system that is not only good-looking but also more informative.
